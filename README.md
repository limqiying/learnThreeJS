# Discover ThreeJS

I learnt three.js over the weekend by following the lessons made by Lewy Blue in Discover [three.js](https://discoverthreejs.com/). The final product of their first section is a beautiful animation of some birds rendered on the browser using WebGL underneath. (It is really cool how three.js abstracts all the configurations and camera controls that are typically involved openGL!)
